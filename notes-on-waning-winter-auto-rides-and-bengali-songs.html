Routines are familiar; you can go to them, and without ever changing anything about them, the comfort you are constantly searching for stays there. My routine is sitting on the terrace of a cafe at the end of the night, then taking an autorickshaw home. The cafe is right next to Faqirchand bookstore; it’s empty at the time I go. It is a weekend routine: I meet my friends, we sit, ponder, gossip, and when they leave for home, I don’t leave. I go to the terrace of the familiar cafe. There isn’t much I do there, however. It usually gets fairly late when I go there, except to revel in the memories of the day spent and the nostalgia etched onto the tables. They have intuitively placed ashtrays on every table outside. I sit at the table right next to the ledge from where you can see parts of the market. I sit, lean onto the stone ledge, take out a book, light a cigarette, try to read the book, and almost always keep it down and gaze onto the empty terrace at night.</p><p>The one thing I have been noticing while sitting there is how quietly the city’s weather has been changing. The winter is waning. The earliest indication of it started right towards the end of January. Back then, we were all wearing four layers, and whenever I sat on the terrace of the cafe, it wasn’t long before I felt a strong chill in the wind overcome me. Whenever I feel cold, I tuck my hands between my thighs, something I have been doing since I was a child. Sitting on my hands has always helped me warm my hands adequately, but it does however get the curious look from people around me. Towards the end of January, the chill started to weaken, becoming less violent than it was. Just as I stop sitting on my hands, I realise that the season has started to change. Nights certainly become easier at this time. Whenever someone asks me what the best time to visit Delhi is, I either tell them autumn or the onset of spring. This is the season the city is in right now. The peak of the season here is always extreme. In the summers, it feels like the ceiling fan is too slow and the AC is not cool enough; in the climax of the winters, it feels as if you’re always one layer short, even if you’re covered from head to toe. It is at this time, when the seasons shift, that the city shines.</p><p>There is no better way to see the extent of the beauty of Delhi than late-night travel in autorickshaws. There are no doors on either side of the vehicle; the wind hits you fiercely, and you can see the city clearly, irrespective of where you sit inside. Indulge me; let me take you into my memories. My family has been a fan of dinners in restaurants. Any small occasion, or sometimes no occasion, warranted a dinner in a restaurant. Mummy and Papa both love South Indian cuisine, so dinner was always at the nearest South Indian restaurant. They don’t go to dinner as often now; the excuses are often work-related, but I see that going out frequently now tyres them more than it used to. Back then, we used to dress up well, and then the four of us took the autorickshaw at night. Papa used to sit on the left, I was in the middle, Mummy was to my right, and my sister was on Mummy’s lap. We were living in a small pocket of South Delhi, near the JNU and IIT campuses. We all used to take the auto to a restaurant in Munirka. A fairly large restaurant with a large terrace — twenty-minute auto ride from where we lived. I think it has been almost ten years since we last went there. I do pass by it on the road sometimes, but the fleeting nostalgia-ridden glance is all I get then. Even after so many years, I can still see the inside as clearly as yesterday. Even more clearly, however, I can see the nighttime autorickshaw ride. As the auto ran on the road, my eyes hovered around the city. The markets, the residential buildings, and the people hurriedly running across the road to cross it. I remember looking at my mother’s hands wrapped around my sister. The yellow streetlights kept running across the inside of the rickshaw — the shadows of the railings of the auto running with the streetlight. As a child, I never liked getting mashed between my parents, and sitting there, I used to think to myself, “When I grow up, I will take the auto at night, alone. From an early age, the idea of growing up and, by extension, having freedom was the liberty to take an autorickshaw at night alone.</p><p>A very dear friend suggested a song to me a little while ago. It’s a Bengali song. I was clueless about the lyrics when I first heard them. My friend took the time to explain the lyrics patiently. In the song, the voice says that he doesn’t need anything as long as he has love for all his life.</p><p>Nobody warns you of the impending loneliness that is in store as you age. When life starts to happen, your friends marry, and they start worrying about buying a house—things you always see other adults do. It suddenly hits you that it's your turn now.</p><p>I wish my thoughts were profound introspections on life, art, and everything else that makes living a little easier, but as I sit in my routine on the terrace of the familiar cafe near Faqirchand, I don’t think of anything extraordinary. I see myself sitting in a room, crowded with boxes of memories, aspirations, and a train of thoughts about what-ifs and what-could-have-beens. The room towers over me, and I, in the middle, am just looking for some way out of the claustrophobia.</p><p>The Bengali song transcended language; it transcended everything tangible for me to sit and tell myself that I too don’t need anything as long as I have love all through my life. The internal room then starts to give me some space to breathe.</p><p>I sit on the terrace, finish my coffee and cigarettes, and start walking to an autorickshaw. We don’t live in a small pocket of South Delhi anymore. The auto ride takes almost forty minutes to reach home now. I sit on the left side of the auto, where Papa sat when all four of us were crammed in it.</p><p>The nights during this time of the year are truly the best time to visit the city. The wind is fierce, but the cold isn’t biting. You won’t feel the urge to sit on your hands to warm them. The coldness is just the right kind; it’s the winter’s desperate final attempt to exist before it leaves for good.</p><p>When the auto runs, my eyes hover around the city but then are transfixed on the yellow streetlight running across the empty space. As a child, I was convinced that being alone in the autorickshaw at night was the true extent of personal freedom. Now, whenever I am coming back home at night, I smile to myself. I tell my past self that we’re both sitting here and that we’re both happy right now.</p><p>I take out my phone to play the familiar Bengali song, and I sing along in the quietness of the waning winter in the city.</p><p></p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aayushyaranjan/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushya-ranjan/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Aayushya Ranjan</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aayushya.in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
