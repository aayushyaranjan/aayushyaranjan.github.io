I had an unrealistic confidence that as soon as I will find myself in the water, I will swim. I jumped to find my head completely submerged. I remember that I was able to see the river beneath with absolute clarity. Yet, at that moment, I could not breathe at all. I came to realize that I can very well drown, my senses completely froze. My hands and legs felt the current and the heaviness of the water. Instinctively, I started to flop my hands to cause a ruckus for someone to notice.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p"><span class="md-plain">Since I was wearing a life jacket, my body started to float. I was too frantic to realize that I wasn't in any actual danger. The river had a strong current that day thus I felt myself floating further away from my raft. I moved my head to see my petrified parents looking over from the raft. Mummy was trying to throw a paddle toward me to latch onto but the current kept taking me away.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p"><span class="md-plain">A feverish panic set in and I was completely paralyzed. At that moment I wanted nothing more than to get out of the water. Every ounce of myself was silently screaming for help but my body wasn't complying. It had become complacent, almost as if it had a mind. Soon after someone came swimming towards me and handed me one hand of a paddle which I immediately grasped.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p"><span class="md-plain">I will be honest with you. I don't remember much of the trip afterward. Just a few fragmented moments here and there. However, the only thing I can remember vividly is the inertia. Sometimes while showering, I get a little out of breath as the water clogs up my nose. Soon as this happens, the memory of the river comes right back. My body had resigned. Even when my mind was constantly panicking to find solutions, my body accepted and resigned itself to complacent inertia.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p"><span class="md-plain">Every time I pick up the pen to write. I fight the very same inertia. My fingers pain, my mind rejects the sentences, I constantly panic about the quality of the writing and my mind often goes to the possibility of public humiliation.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p"><span class="md-plain">Not writing for me is the same as drowning. I will drown in a life of mediocracy and regret. I will drown and never pick up the pen again. I don't want to look back and see this as an effort to build a childish utopia.</span></p><p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus"><span class="md-plain md-expand">This time there is no one swimming toward me. This time somehow I will have to wash ashore. All words here are my attempts to flop around inside the river. I can't see the bottom of the river nor can I see the light from above. Just clear water and my attempts to break the inertia, one word at a time.</span></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aayushya.in/media/posts/4/Photo-for-newsletter-Drowing-2.jpg" alt="" width="578" height="578" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://aayushya.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Photo-for-newsletter-Drowing-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://aayushya.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Photo-for-newsletter-Drowing-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://aayushya.in/media/posts/4/responsive/Photo-for-newsletter-Drowing-2-md.jpg 768w"></figure><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aayushyaranjan/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushya-ranjan/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Â© Aayushya Ranjan</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aayushya.in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
