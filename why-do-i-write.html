I could not find one tangible reason to tell him why I wrote. In an attempt to shrug off the question and with the conversation I told him that it’s second nature to me—a half-true answer. I don’t know the truth myself. It’s not like I haven’t asked this question to myself. I have from time to time and the answers I usually give myself have been, ‘It’s a noble pursuit’, ‘It’s an art, you’re an artist’, ‘If not this, what else?’ It’s actually the last statement I relate with the most. If not this, what else? A rhetoric question.</p><p>A mental image of a straight line getting split into many tangents comes to mind. In one reality I would’ve never touched a book. I would’ve then been blissfully unaware of the beauty that exists in literature and by the time I would’ve had the access to buy books, it would’ve been too late to cultivate a genuine interest. Another reality could’ve been that I would’ve never been given the freedom to pursue what I wanted. By the time I got older, I would’ve then become bitter towards life. It would be a big thought of what could’ve been on my mind for all time to come. The reality however is that my house growing up was littered with books. It still is. An old copy of Wuthering Heights used to be kept on the top of a pile and I used to flip through it. I would take in the smell of oxidized paper, and try to read a few lines only to get bored eventually. Growing up, papa used to ask both my sister and me to write short stories. I remember writing about water fascinated me on TV at that juncture. Mostly superhero and fantasy stuff, the cliche of a kid growing up in the early 2000s applied to me. All my favourite TV shows were fantasy in one way or the other and my short stories at the time reflected that. The habit did not last over the years but a very real affection had begun for the written word.</p><p>Anytime I have been writing or thinking to write a story, it always involves a protagonist be lost in the middle of nowhere. Over the course of the story, the protagonist finds his way by doing something or something being done to him that gives him a new perspective. I almost always end the story there. What happens then is a different journey. Getting to the point when the miracle happens is the journey I take the characters on. I wonder if that’s a reflection of my own aspiration.</p><p>Essays have had a weird image in my mind. My introduction to the format came as a school kid. Essays throughout school were long explanations of a central theme. ‘My favourite festival’, ‘My favourite memory’, I remember teachers always asking us to write about the importance of Independence Day and Republic Day around the time of these events. It always felt unnecessary to me and I never liked to do it, thus a very skewed perception to the format. It wasn’t until a few years back when I was trying to find a format where I could write about my life—an extension of my mind on paper without it being a diary entry. I was trying to find a format where I could sit, put ink to paper, and let it all out. That’s when I came across the word again. Essays. Popular literary magazines publish writers writing about their lives, experiences, and meanderings. It felt like a breath of fresh air.</p><p>Some of the essays that I have read almost always go into complex themes while invoking simple human emotions. Even as I write this, I am still hoping I find my way but I don’t know if I know life, culture, or art enough to make such complex metaphors. Mine are simple emotions steeped in nostalgia with the hope of not getting lost in it. You are reading this sentence, through time and space and I can speak to you. Think about it, it’s such a beautiful emotion.</p><p>It was an accident when it so happened that I opened and read a page from my grandfather’s journal. He had started off the journal with a greeting for the new year. It was a small, red, thick journal and my grandfather was speaking to the reader. It started as a greeting for successful new years for a reader he did not even know was there. The instinct of writing, I imagine came to him as soon as there was a reader or a listener. Just someone who takes the time out of the day, sit deliberately, and read. I always contended until a few years back that any type of art is corrupted when it’s made solely for an audience. I was under the impression that if you are engaging in an artistic pursuit it should be just because you want to. Anytime you write or make something for the sole reason to impress someone, then it ceases to become art, it becomes kitsch—a product to be sold. That is until the bubble broke for me. The bubble when real adult life starts happening around you bursts and suddenly you find choosing to do what makes you happy or to settle to make a comfortable life. And to do both, a bold determination with slight foolish optimism comes—you choose to do what makes you happy and to make a career out of it. So again the question I keep asking myself. Why do I write? Is it a need to put ink on paper just so I understand life better, is it to show the world that I too am a person capable of complex thought, is it just to earn money?</p><p>I don’t know if I can explain the feeling in my mind but nevertheless, I will try my best. Ever since I can remember whenever I have sat down to write, a poem, a story, or an essay, the world always seems to disappear. It is me, the feeling of the pen’s nib on paper, my hand on the table with no fear. At the moment there exists no fear of the world, the life you have to make, the thought of failure, the intimidation of blank pages. Nothing. AN unadulterated joy of being able to translate my mind on paper. For moments, one that I am experiencing as I write this, there is nothing else but this.</p><p>The written word— poem, fiction, non-fiction all of it is a prayer. It is my way of making sense and pursuing a purpose, a purpose to create something that makes your living better, a way for the voice inside to go out and find a reader, a listener, someone paying attention of what I have to say.</p><p>So why do I write? I write because as soon as the pen cap opens there is nothing between me, the ink, the page. I write because I am a mortal and only through a tangible piece of work will I ever rest easy knowing there is evidence of me being alive. I write because when I do I start finding clues into my own questions about living. I write to pray, to hope, to make sense of a world that seems to get more confusing by the day.</p><p>I write because, if not this, what else?</p><p></p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aayushyaranjan/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushya-ranjan/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Aayushya Ranjan</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aayushya.in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
