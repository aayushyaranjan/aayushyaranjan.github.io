            "content_html": "<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">Today I read that the sun is going to swallow the earth in 5 Billion years. The earth and life as we know it is going to be utterly destroyed just as mysteriously it was created.</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">I don't have a recollection of the earth being born. I don't know what life was in the last century let alone from the beginning of material time. The prospect of dying from a world-ending catastrophe has been the foremost fear I have always had. Existentialists, therapy sessions helped me get through the fear with various insights. All these insights had but one thing in common, \"This moment will not come back, savour it.\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">But exactly is savouring it? Savouring a dish or a drink would constitute that I should eat or drink slowly. Take my time to take in the delicate taste.</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">I truly believe that life can't be savoured. I am almost 26 and I have only been able to savour a handful of small moments. Moments which are embedded in my skin.</span></p>\n<ul class=\"ul-list\" data-mark=\"-\">\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">A throat itch after a concert or a long day with friends.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">Warm sun on a cold Delhi morning.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">The smell of papad.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">The scent of a bookstore.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">Mummy &amp; Papa's embrace.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">The burn of flaming ash from a cigarette dropped right onto my exposed skin.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">Biting into a juicy kebab after a long day.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"md-list-item\">\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">Looking at someone's photograph long after they have left your life.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">These among many other things are what I carry around on my shoulders. I should very well carry a placard announcing, \"I have lived too!\"</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">And indeed I have, I have lived in every new dish I tried. I have lived in every cigarette I shared with my sister. I have lived in every song I sang with my friends. I have lived every time I forgave myself for being terrible at something.</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\"><span class=\"md-plain\">So if the sun takes the earth, I hope it collapses on its own weight and gets destroyed to bits. How dare he take the lives which we lived or unlived?</span></p>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p md-focus\"><span class=\"md-plain md-expand\">How dare the sun?</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://aayushya.in/media/posts/3/autodraw-11_11_2022.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"3072\" height=\"1655\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)\" srcset=\"https://aayushya.in/media/posts/3/responsive/autodraw-11_11_2022-xs.png 300w ,https://aayushya.in/media/posts/3/responsive/autodraw-11_11_2022-sm.png 480w ,https://aayushya.in/media/posts/3/responsive/autodraw-11_11_2022-md.png 768w\"></figure>\n<p>Â </p>",
