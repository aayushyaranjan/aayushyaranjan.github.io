While I do write in a journal, it's mostly a vomit of emotions and feelings that I have to get out so that I don't feel emotionally puke-ish the entire day. It's different here. This is not bound by the constraint of an essay or a story, there is no format or an outpour of emtions. It's just simple unudulturated writing. I used to watch people in TV shows and films maintain a blog. I kinda get it now.</p><p>We're on the topic of writing. Let me tell you something about it. My affinity with literature and writing is both the best thing that happened to me but also the source of a constant unhappiness. Papa is a writer and he learnt to write and read english very late in his life. He always felt that his co-ed english speaking school kids should make full use of the ability to read and write english from as early as they can. I think I must have been in the 2nd or the 3rd grade when he used to ask me to write a story. The seed which was planted then, kept germinating throughout the years and is biggening to break the soil as I write this. His affinity to english was contagious and my sister and I both started writing stories very early in our lives. I don't know where where those notebooks are and I frankly can't care enough. It was mostly thriller, fights, mystery in those stories. Everything that I destest from writing now. If you have read anything I have written, you would see that I am constantly after the pursuit of finding something meaningful and deep in the ordinary. Thriller, Violence, Mystery is still intruiging to read but growing up I saw everyone to be so caught up in the escapism that no beauty was left to be seen in the ordinary. All there is around us is a treasure trove of ordinary communication. Everytime I go out I keep my ears open for any interesting tidbits from the people around me. It's either money, or someone's attittude towards them or deciding where to eat most of the time. I am trying to find stories there. From whenever I have had the sensibility of starting to read a novel, I always picked up the book that took me farthest from everywhere. The escapism. The escape into literature and films show immersive danger that can always get out thrilled but never put you in the harms way. I used to imagine being a part of the secret seven and I become a boyfriend to one of those girls. Do people really not like listening to the truth? It's comforting. It helps you to see that whatever it is, you're not alone. You have felt this way and so have others. </p><p>It came crashing down today. All the expectations and standards I set for myself. Apart from the journal writng anything felt like such a task. Writing has become both the ailment and the medicine. The ongoing battle between writing without a worry in the world,and the writing in the confines of what constitues fiction.</p><p>While it does feel like it, it's not the end of the world, right?</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://aayushya.in/media/posts/7/Drawing-2.jpeg" alt="" width="878" height="448" sizes="(min-width: 1500px) calc(7.87vw + 610px), (min-width: 900px) calc(44.48vw + 68px), (min-width: 780px) calc(8vw + 604px), calc(84.35vw + 23px)" srcset="https://aayushya.in/media/posts/7/responsive/Drawing-2-xs.jpeg 300w, https://aayushya.in/media/posts/7/responsive/Drawing-2-sm.jpeg 480w, https://aayushya.in/media/posts/7/responsive/Drawing-2-md.jpeg 768w"></figure><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aayushyaranjan/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushya-ranjan/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Aayushya Ranjan</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aayushya.in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
