I remember reading Shakespeare at a very young age and not being able to make any sense of it. Years later now when I picked up Hamlet, I find myself gaping at half the things he writes there. Each word, each sentence is chosen so carefully. You can pick up the character's mood, his intentions, his madness - all from mere words.</p><p>It's weird how writing and reading are so exclusive and yet connected so deeply. There can be no reading if writers don't write and it takes time then to read, understand what authors are trying to say through the text. All the writers are readers but not all readers are writers. But can one after enough reading, become a good writer? By that logic, all the librarians and bookshop owners should be incredible writers. Why isn't that so? I don't understand it fully, infact I am barely scratching the ground with my nails but I understand what propelled Kafka or Cavafy to write everyday after their day jobs. They must've come home tired too, how easy must've been for them to toss their notebook aside and try to breathe and get ready for the next day of work. It would have been a tragedy. The inner fire, the innate urge, the unquenchable thirst, the raging fire, every person who has ever created something, they need to have this, right?</p><p>It's so consuming though. The entire day, one just keeps listening to others talk. This is where a writer gets the blood to give to his fiction. Someone who writes fiction, even if their work is removed from this world, it still holds its basis in the human conditon. The need to talk, the need to be heard, the need to belong, the need to posses, the need to love and the need to cry. How can anyone possibly have the power to make you feel intimately connected to the fictional prince of Denmark and his all-consuming need for revenge and a slow decent into madness? That too from hundreds of years ago. His voice, his ambitions, his fever dreams all written have travelled years to become legendary texts. Even he will be forgotten someday, but until the day comes when the last person to know of Shakespeare utters his name and dies himself, Shakespeare lives. A kind of immortality that cannot come from just being a good writer, it comes from borrowing a piece of the heart and mind and putting it in in every text. </p><p>Sometimes the weight of the existing literature feels so heavy. It's a never ending ocean. There are days where I go into a bookstore and sit on the floor. As I sit on the floor I look up and I see enormous towering shelves of books all of them seem like they would fall on me at any second. It's odd though, I go sit and stare at books for hours. The old legacy bookstores are filled with world-class literature, authors and titles you almost always have heard of. The other bookstores however, the second hand ones, they are filled with obscure authors who wrote their heart out and nobody either remembers them or has heard about them. One or two copies of their books reach these wholesame booksellers and they reach on these second hand shelves getting dust. They are almost always very thick. 300-400 hundred pages and when you read the excerpt, almost always the story is something gritty or over the top romantic, almost as if the author is presenting you with a bouquet of flowers drenched in colonge. The prospect is frightening. Every one of them sat down one day, started wrtiting out with one word and did not stop until they had the finished story. Maybe they went to traditional publishers for years until they realised that the only recourse they had was a vanity publication or self publishing. It's still their sweat, tears, and blood. They must've dreamt about the story, their charcters must've stayed on their minds for months, a long ardous journey - for what. To get their books thrown around by wholesale booksellers into shops no one goes to anymore and dissolve into oblivion.</p><p>Oblivion is inevitable. People are already starting to forget about some of the greats. The entropy of the memory of the book is an affliction which is going to come for everyone. Why then write? Well, It's similar to living. There is no absolute in life except death. There is no other destination we're going to. Everything else in life is a detour all going towards the same destination. Then why not jump off a nice tall building, or cut your veins and bleed to death almost like drifting off into sleep. The mortality of life gives it meaning, I think similarly the mortality of art and the process of making it gives it meaning too. You're a spec of dust, you're wormfood, the only importance your life has is that you can help others enrich theirs. Your friends, family, or anyone for that matter. </p><p>So I write for you. I write so that maybe in my words you find yourself and in the proceess I find myself too. I am scared of the dark and I am scared that whenever I sleep I am not going to wake up the next morning. You have the same fears, don't you? Well, irrespective of the fate. Should it have a booker prize winner sticker or just lost in the oblivion, I'll still write. If it makes even 1 person, laugh, cry, sentimental, or just a little less lost. My work would be complete.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/aayushyaranjan/" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushya-ranjan/" class="linkedin" aria-label="LinkedIn"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://aayushya.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">© Aayushya Ranjan</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://aayushya.in/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=27706a8fe221267c1834098c796f44c1"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
